# Root Equals Sum of Children - LeetCode

[https://leetcode.com/problems/root-equals-sum-of-children/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/root-equals-sum-of-children/description/)

You are given the `root` of a **binary tree** that consists of exactly `3` nodes: the root, its left child, and its right child.

Return `true` *if the value of the root is equal to the **sum** of the values of its two children, or* `false` *otherwise*.

**Example 1:**

```
Output: true
Explanation: The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 10, 4, and 6, respectively.
10 is equal to 4 + 6, so we return true.

```

**Example 2:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/04/08/graph3drawio-1.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/04/08/graph3drawio-1.png)

```
Input: root = [5,3,1]
Output: false
Explanation: The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 5, 3, and 1, respectively.
5 is not equal to 3 + 1, so we return false.

```

**Constraints:**

- The tree consists only of the root, its left child, and its right child.
- `100 <= Node.val <= 100`
